A Note to the TA's:

I have a bunch of extra commits around 7.4 because I was having a lot of trouble getting the .gitignore file to work. I finally got it to work by deleting the APIkeys.swift file and then recreating it, but if you're going through my commit history and are confused about all those commits and that extra branch that's what all that stuff was about.
